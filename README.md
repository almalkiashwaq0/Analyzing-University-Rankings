## Introduction
The objective of this project is to perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a dataset related to university rankings. The goal is to uncover meaningful insights and patterns within the data that can help us better understand the factors that contribute to a university's ranking.

### Dataset Overview and Source
The dataset used for this project contains information about the rankings of universities from around the world. The dataset includes various features such as the university name, location, ranking score, and several other attributes. The dataset was obtained from [a reputable source, e.g., QS World University Rankings or Times Higher Education World University Rankings]](https://www.shanghairanking.com/rankings/arwu/2022 , https://www.timeshighereducation.com/rankings/impact/overall/2023#!/length/100/sort_by/scores_overall/sort_order/desc , https://www.cwur.org/2023.php).


## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

### Data Profiling
1-relabbilty
2-timeness
3-consistency
4-Relevance :
Assess whether the data is appropriate and applicable for the intended analysis. Data that is not relevant can skew results and lead to incorrect conclusions.
5- Uniqueness:
Check for and remove duplicate records to prevent skewed analysis results.
6-Completeness:
Ensure that no critical data is missing. This might mean checking for null values or required fields that are empty.
7- Check Accuracy:
Verify that the data is correct and precise. This could involve comparing data samples with known sources or using validation rules.

### Data Cleaninga
-Handling missing values
-Correcting errors.
-Dealing with outliers.


### Univariate Analysis
Where is the center of the data? (location) --> Measures of central tendency
How much does the data vary? (scale) --> Measure of variability
What is the shape of the data? (shape) --> Measures of variation combined with an average (measure of center)

### mul/Bi variate Analysis
Here, you look at the relationships between two or more variables. This can involve looking for correlations, patterns, and trends that suggest a relationship or an association.
